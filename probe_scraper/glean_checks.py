DUPLICATE_METRICS_EMAIL_TEMPLATE = """
Glean has detected duplicated metric identifiers coming from the product '{repo.name}'.

{duplicates}

What to do about this:

1. File a bug to track your investigation. You can just copy this email into the bug Description to get you started.
2. Reply-All to this email to let the list know that you are investigating. Include the bug number so we can help out.
3. Rename the most recently added metric to be more specific. See [1]
4. Make sure a Glean team member reviews any patches. Care needs to be taken that the resolution of this problem is schema-compatible.

If you have any problems, please ask for help on the #glean Slack channel. We'll give you a hand.

What this is:

We have a system called probe-scraper [2] that scrapes the metric information from all Mozilla products using the Glean SDK. All the scraped data is available on the probeinfo service [3]. The scraped definition is used to build things such as the probe-dictionary [4] and other data tools. It detected that one metric that was recently added has an identifier collision with some metric that already existed in the application namespace. So it sent this email out, encouraging you to fix the problem.

What happens if you don't fix this:

The metrics will compete to send their data in pings, making the data unreliable at best.

You can do this!
