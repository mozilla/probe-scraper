# This file is used both to generate API docs and as the source for schema
# definitions. Note that OpenAPI has a concept of component schemas that is
# very similar to, but not quite JSON Schema. We use a standard jsonschema
# validation library in this codebase, so we need to be careful to keep the
# schema definitions here to the subset supported by both JSON schema and
# OpenAPI. There are some comments below to describe the few places where
# that becomes an issue.

      description: |
        A lowercase_with_underscores name that is short and unambiguous. It needs to be something that can be used both in a generated table name in BigQuery or as a value in an `app_name` string field in a derived table. BigQuery users might be using this literal name in a `WHERE` clause, so it should feel reasonable for that use case. Examples: `fenix`, `firefox_ios`.

        This is an "end-to-end identifier": wherever there is a field called `app_name`
        from probe scraping to user-facing derived tables in BigQuery, it should reflect
        this exact value.
      example: firefox_ios

    CanonicalAppName:
      type: string
      description: |
        How we would formally name this application in marketing copy or in a dashboard. This should not be materialized in ETL, but rather only made available in user-facing views since it may be verbose and it may change over time. Examples: Firefox for Android, Firefox for Android (Legacy Fennec), Firefox for Desktop, Firefox Focus for iOS

        This is an "end-to-end identifier": wherever there is a field called
        `canonical_app_name` from probe scraping to user-facing derived tables in BigQuery,
        it should reflect this exact value.
      example: Firefox for iOS

    AppChannel:
      type: string
      enum:
        - release
        - beta
        - nightly
        - esr
      description: |
        The release channel.
        If this is not specified, then we assume the application provides a reasonable channel value in
        `client_info.app_channel` in its pings.

    AppId:
      type: string
      pattern: '^[a-z][a-zA-Z0-9._-]{0,1023}$'
      description: |
        The app's identifier exactly as it appears in the relevant app store listing (for relevant platforms) or in the app's Glean initialization call (for other platforms). In the case of the Google Play store, it may contain both dots and dashes. For applicable platforms, you should be able to construct an app store URL from this value.

        This is an "end-to-end identifier": wherever there is a field called `app_id`
        from probe scraping to user-facing derived tables in BigQuery, it should reflect
        this exact value.
      example: "org.mozilla.firefox_beta"

    DocumentNamespace:
      type: string
      pattern: "^[a-z][a-z-]{0,1023}$"
      description: |
        Derived from `app_id`, this is the lowercase-with-dashes value that appears
        as the `document_namespace` element of the submission URI for a ping.
      example: org-mozilla-firefox-beta
